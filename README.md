# This repository is for the application for the Marlo competition team.

This repository includes two RL methods, Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning. "CartPole.ipynb" is using "Q-Learning" , and "CartPole_DQN.ipynb" is using Deep Q-Learning.

Just Q-Learning didn't go well. Please see "CartPole_DQN.ipynb".
